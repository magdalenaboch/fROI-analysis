# fROI-analysis

matlab scripts to create individual functional regions-of-interest (fROIs) within anatomical search spaces based on top-% active voxels for a given localizer contrast (e.g. top-10% active voxels for faces > inanimate objects within fusiform gyrus to define individual face fROI) and to extract parameter estimates from left out data set (i.e. second run). The script also allows you to create fROIs for a range of percentages (e.g. from 1% to 100% in steps of 5%).
